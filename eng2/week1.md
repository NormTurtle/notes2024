# Figure of speech
- Figures of speech are `literary` devices whose function is to present an idea without directly making a reference to it.
- they do not provide for literal interpretation
- to make comparisons, they are usually used to present the same idea in different ways


## simile
- use of `like` or `as` to draw the comparison.
- simile are used in the comparison of two completely unassociated thing or ideas.
E.g :
- "O my luve is like red, red rose"
- "kid is like lion"
- "modest as a hermit"
- "a face as dull as lead"
- " Brave as lion"
- "cute like puffy"

## metaphor
- A metaphor is a thing that is similar to another thing, but it is not an exact copy of the other.
- type of comparisoin in which a word or phrase is used in place of other to suggest a likeness or analogy between them.
- when using word/phrase as metaphor, it does not carry its literal meaning.
E.g
- "Silene is golden"

## personification.
- a thing or idea is given human attributes or emotions.
- like just considering a thing its alive or is a person.
E.g
- "my Laptop is my companion"
- "The moon told me."
- "my phone too smart bruh"

## paradox.
- situation or statement that is true but impossible or conflicting.
- consist of two contrasting fact or statement.
E.g
- " I must be cruel to be kind "
- " everyone is equal , whether  they are different"

## oxymoron
- Two word with a opposite meaning.
- used to express conflicting opinion or thought.
- oxymoron combines contradictory but paradox combines contradictory ideas

E.g
- " it was a bitter-sweet experience"
- " that was awfully good "
- " being with her was a sweet sorrow"
- "living dead"

## antithesis
- involves two components in opposition at the same.


E.g
- " one step of man , giant leap of mankind"
- " no pain, no gain"

## alliteration
- literary device in whcih the first sounds of two adjacent word are repeated.
- more common on poem. used to make catcy phrase
E.g
- "Betty baked buns besides bacons."
- " tiktok "
- " kikat "
- " Peppa pig"     <!-- `p` is repeated -->


explanations of some of the most common figures of speech:

1. **Simile**: A simile is a comparison between two unlike things using the words "like" or "as." For example, "Her smile was as bright as the sun."

2. **Metaphor**: Similar to a simile, a metaphor also compares two unlike things, but without using "like" or "as." It asserts that one thing is another thing. For example, "The world is a stage."

3. **Personification**: Personification attributes human characteristics to non-human entities or abstract concepts. For instance, "The wind whispered through the trees."

4. **Hyperbole**: Hyperbole involves exaggeration for emphasis or effect. For example, "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse."

5. **Alliteration**: Alliteration is the repetition of initial consonant sounds in neighboring words or syllables. For instance, "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."

6. **Onomatopoeia**: Onomatopoeia refers to words that imitate the sound associated with the object or action they refer to. For example, "buzz," "bang," or "hiss."

7. **Irony**: Irony is the use of language where the intended meaning is different from the literal meaning, often for humorous or emphatic effect. There are several types of irony, including verbal irony (saying one thing but meaning another), situational irony (when the outcome is different from what is expected), and dramatic irony (when the audience knows something the characters do not).

8. **Oxymoron**: An oxymoron is a combination of contradictory or incongruous words, such as "jumbo shrimp" or "bittersweet."

9. **Metonymy**: Metonymy is a figure of speech in which one word or phrase is substituted with another that is closely associated with it. For example, referring to the king as "the crown."

10. **Synecdoche**: Synecdoche is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to represent the whole, or vice versa. For instance, "all hands on deck" (referring to sailors).

These are just a few examples of the many figures of speech used in language to convey meaning, evoke imagery, and add depth to communication.
