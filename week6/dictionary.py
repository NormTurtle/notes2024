# a collection of { key : values } pairs inside of { curlly brakcet }
# dict_name  = { key1: value1, key2:value2, key3:value3, ..... }

# dictionay truths
# can't have keys with same names, key should always be unique
# dictionary is *Mutable*  ( can be changed/updated )

# lenght of dict
# `len()` gives the lenght of list,dict, prretty much all data
# in dict. as `len(dict_name)` it is going to give number of keys:value pairs
# e.g | dict = { 'a':1,'b':2,'c':3 }
# `len(dict)`  # output : 3   ( as there is 3 keys as (a,b,c) )

# Dict construtor
# e.g # dict_name = dict('a':1,'b':2,'c',3)
